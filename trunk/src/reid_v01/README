Re-Identifiation (ReID) Project (Version 0.1; 10/25/2011)
==========================================================

* This directory contains the following:

  papers/
	- A KDD'11 paper and LLNL poster on this project

  graphs/ 
	- Contains two IM data graphs from the Yahoo!
	- One is used as the target (anonymized) graph and the other as the reference (known) graph

  data/
	- Contains sample IM data used by the ReID code

  src/
	- Contains the Java source code for the project

  bin/
	- Contains the Javac object code


* To run the code do the following:

  1. Compile the code in the src directory by simply running javac.
	javac -d bin src/*.java

  2.  To run the code
	- Check out the main routine and its comments in src/IdentityResolution.java
	- The code has many bells and whistles.  For those, check out the main routines in these files:
		src/CalculateFeatures.java
		src/GenerateEdgeGuesses.java
		src/GenerateFeatures.java
		src/IDResPostEdgeProcess.java
		src/IDResPostProcess.java
		src/RankedRoleFinder.java
		src/RoleIDFeatureCalculator.java
		src/RoleIDItertaion.java

* Disclaimer: This is rather new research prototype code so it doesn't have all the niceties of a mature code.
